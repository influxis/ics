Steps

1) Create a Flex project (preferrably using Flash or Flex builder).
2) Copy the contents or the mxml file to the src directory within the project.
3) Copy LCCS_JS_Bridge.js & cursor.png from SDKApp/payload/libs/JavaScript to the html-template directory in your flex project.
4) Overwrite the index.template.html inside the html-template directory with the file provided in the sample Apps. (Saves you the effort of figuring our configuration details)

* Works really well with Web-Kit based browsers such as Safari, Mozilla & Chrome.
